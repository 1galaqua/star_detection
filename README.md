**algorithm explanation:**

The algorithm for finding star matches works by using trigonometric similarity.
It searches for all the stars in the image, converts them into a two-dimensional graph, 
computes all the triangles that can exist among those points, 
calculates the angles of those triangles, and in doing so, 
looks for similarity between the two given images.
